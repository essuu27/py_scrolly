This is py-scrolly, a script that scrolls text across a window.
It does strange things to the text....
..and stranger things with the backdrop.
It was written as a learning project and a "proof of concept"....
... to see how well python manipulates graphics .....
... also because I was curious to see if it could be done ....
You can add your own text effects, if you want.
A big "thank you!" to U4iaF8 for the music playing in the background.
